### Rule Modifications/Clarification
- Turns pass in a clockwise fashion. If you are not first or last, a dashed line will clarify your turn order.
- A coup involves an additional character selection and will be unsuccessful if the targeted player does not possess the targeted character. 
- It is possible to steal from a player with zero coins, though stealing in this case will produce no net gain or loss of coins from either side if successful.
