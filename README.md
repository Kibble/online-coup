## About

This version of Coup can be played online with 2-8 players and features a lobby, player chat, turn log, and action statistics. <br>

### Rule Modifications & Game Clarification

- With 7 or 8 players, the deck will have 20 total cards (4 of each character). <br>
- If you do no go first or last, a dashed line will clarify your turn order. Turns pass in a clockwise fashion, and the first player is decided randomly.
- A coup involves a character guess and will be unsuccessful if the guess is incorrect (i.e. the targeted player does not possess that character).
- Stealing from a player with 0 coins produces no net gain or loss of coins from either side if successful.

**Refer to the in-game rules panel for additional clarification.

### Notes
- Online Coup is currently in beta testing. It may take time to load some images, and bugs may occur while playing.
- When using a mobile device (not recommended), play in landscape mode for the best experience.
- ***Please use the LEAVE button to exit a room or a game.***
